# GSRI Skydiving usage guide

This documentation provides guidelines on how to use this mod.

## Installing

### Client side
This mod is simply installed by subscribing on the Steam Workshop GSRI Skydiving page (FIXME). Start Arma 3 launcher and it will download and install the mod automatically.

### Server side
This mod is required on server-side as well. Upload the mod to your server and add the `-mod=` argument to load the addon. If you want to play on a server with pbo signature check on, you will need to upload the key file to your `keys` directory as well.

## Configuring
You can enable or disable the newtonian feature using CBA settings. Go to `game settings` > `addons settings` > `server` > `GSRI Skydiving`.

## Playing
If the feature is enabled, next time you jump out of the plane you will get dragged towards the plane for a few seconds. Simply eject from the plane, either through `2Ã— V` or use the mouse wheel menu.
